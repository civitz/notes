# The video

[This computer will grow your food in the future | Caleb Harper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEx6K4P4GJc)

# Thoughts

After watching this video (but i recall thinking about it before today) i feel interested on the topic of
automatic farming, vertical farming, and technology of farming in general.

# Ideas

Experiment with an automatic greenhouse (i don't have green thumb...), start with an [IKEA greenhouse](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/70186603/), maybe.
